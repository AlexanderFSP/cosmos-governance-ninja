## üìô Description

[Cosmos Governance Ninja](https://cosmos-governance-ninja.alexanderfsp.com) is a minimalistic client app that provides bulk voting capabilities on proposals in Cosmos CDK-based blockchains. Currently, about 20 networks are supported, such as Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, dYdX, Saga, Stride, Kujira, Stargaze, Juno, Kava, Nibiru, etc.

#### What problems does this application solve:
* It reduces the number of necessary actions. Those who use a cold wallet (e.g., Ledger) know how tedious it can be to click buttons countless times to confirm a transaction. When voting through this application, all votes are collected in one "batch", requiring only one signature.
* It reduces costs. Since all the votes are collected together, this significantly reduces the gas limit required to complete the transaction. For example, in Cosmos Hub, processing a transaction with only 1 vote will require ~55,000 gas. But if it already contains 2, then the limit will be ~65,000 (-40% compared to if we voted separately).

#### Technological stack:

* `Nx@18.2.3` & `Angular@17.3`
* `@cosmjs/stargate@0.32.3`
* Free RPC & REST endpoints [from PublicNode, which is powered by Allnodes](https://www.publicnode.com) ‚ù§Ô∏è
